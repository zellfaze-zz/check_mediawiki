check_mediawiki
===============

This is a Nagios plugin meant to allow you to check that a Mediawiki
installation is still running and that it is running the newest version of
Mediawiki.  This plugin issues a critical alert if it can't find Mediawiki,
a Warning alert if Mediawiki is out of date, and an Unknown alert for any other
problems.

To determine the most recent version of Mediawiki this plugin checks the
Mediawiki item on Wikidata.

Note: This plugin is currently not finished.  All of the code for checking that
Mediawiki is online and up-to-date is in place, but the actual Nagios plugin
bit still needs some work.
